# Welcome to vCluster 105 — Backup and Disaster Recovery

In this scenario, we'll explore backup and disaster recovery strategies for vClusters, building on the advanced configuration concepts from vCluster 104.

We'll build on the advanced vCluster configuration we've been working with to:
- Create snapshots of vClusters
- Restore vClusters from backups
- Implement disaster recovery procedures
- Manage backup strategies for production environments

This scenario focuses on ensuring your vCluster environments can be protected and recovered in case of failures.
