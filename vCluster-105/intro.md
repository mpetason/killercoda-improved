# Welcome to vCluster 105 — Practical Use Cases and Integration Patterns

In this final scenario of our learning series, we'll explore practical real-world use cases for vClusters and how they integrate with common Kubernetes workflows and tools.

We'll cover:
- How to use vClusters in CI/CD pipelines
- Creating developer sandbox environments
- Setting up testing and staging environments
- Integration with service meshes and other Kubernetes tools
- Backup and disaster recovery strategies

This scenario demonstrates how vCluster can be used in actual production environments to solve real-world multi-tenancy challenges.
