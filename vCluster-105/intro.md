# Welcome to vCluster 105 — Backup and Disaster Recovery

Having a backup and recovery strategy is essential for any production environment. vClusters can be backed up at multiple levels depending on your recovery needs.

In this scenario we will cover:

- Creating a vCluster with workloads worth backing up
- Exporting Kubernetes resources as YAML for backup
- Backing up the vCluster's data store
- Simulating a disaster by deleting the vCluster
- Restoring from backup
- Planning a DR strategy

By the end, you will understand how to protect your vCluster workloads and recover from failures.
