# Welcome to vCluster 106 — Advanced Security and RBAC Configurations

## What is vCluster?

vCluster lets teams run virtual Kubernetes clusters on existing host clusters, giving each tenant an isolated control plane without creating separate physical clusters. It supports tenancy models from simple namespace isolation to fully dedicated nodes, GPUs, and bare metal. Environments are defined declaratively for easy, repeatable provisioning. By consolidating many virtual clusters onto fewer hosts, teams cut Kubernetes costs and simplify multi-tenant operations.

## What You'll Learn

In this scenario, you'll learn how to implement advanced security configurations and RBAC management for vClusters. You'll explore:

- Custom RBAC rule configurations
- Pod security context configurations
- Service account management
- API server security hardening
- Comprehensive security policy enforcement

## What This Lab Covers

This scenario builds on the foundation established in previous scenarios and explores advanced security configurations and RBAC management for production-grade vCluster deployments. You'll learn how to implement fine-grained access controls, configure security policies, and manage authentication mechanisms that are essential for secure vCluster environments.

After completing this scenario, you'll have the knowledge needed to secure your vCluster deployments against common security threats and compliance requirements.
