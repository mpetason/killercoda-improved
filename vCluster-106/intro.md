# Welcome to vCluster 106 — Tenancy Models

vCluster supports multiple tenancy models depending on your isolation needs. Each model balances cost, performance, and security differently.

In this scenario we will cover:

- The three main tenancy models: Shared, Dedicated, and Private Nodes
- How Autonodes provide auto-scaling node pools per tenant
- When to use each model
- Hands-on demonstration of the Shared Nodes model

By the end, you will understand how to choose the right tenancy model for your use case.
