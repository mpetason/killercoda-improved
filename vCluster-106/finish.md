# Congratulations! You've completed the vCluster 106 Scenario.

You learned about vCluster tenancy models:

- **Shared Nodes** — Cost-efficient, all workloads on same nodes
- **Dedicated Nodes** — Workload separation via nodeSelectors and taints
- **Private Nodes** — Exclusive node ownership per vCluster
- **Autonodes** — Auto-scaling node pools with Karpenter
