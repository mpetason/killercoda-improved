Congratulations — you saw how vCluster helps tenants run identical application and service names independently.

You created two virtual clusters, deployed the same application and service name into each, exposed them, and verified independent access.

## Try it Out

Try it out now with [vCluster in Docker (vind)](https://github.com/loft-sh/vind) or try it out with [vCluster Free Tier](http://vcluster.com/pricing).
