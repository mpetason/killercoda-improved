# Welcome to vCluster 108 — Istio Service Mesh Integration

## What is vCluster?

vCluster lets teams run virtual Kubernetes clusters on existing host clusters, giving each tenant an isolated control plane without creating separate physical clusters. It supports tenancy models from simple namespace isolation to fully dedicated nodes, GPUs, and bare metal. Environments are defined declaratively for easy, repeatable provisioning. By consolidating many virtual clusters onto fewer hosts, teams cut Kubernetes costs and simplify multi-tenant operations.

## What You'll Learn

In this scenario, you'll learn how to use vCluster with service mesh integration, specifically with Istio. You'll explore how to deploy and configure Istio in a vCluster environment to provide service mesh capabilities.

You'll learn how to:
- Set up a vCluster with Istio integration
- Deploy a sample application in the vCluster
- Configure Istio for traffic management and observability
- Test service mesh features like circuit breaking and retries
- Implement security policies with Istio

## What This Lab Covers

This lab builds on the concepts learned in previous vCluster scenarios and demonstrates advanced usage patterns for service mesh integration in virtual clusters. You'll learn how to combine the isolation benefits of vCluster with the powerful service mesh capabilities of Istio.

After completing this scenario, you'll have the knowledge needed to implement production-grade service mesh solutions in vCluster environments.
