# Welcome to vCluster 104 — Advanced Configuration and Performance Optimization

## What is vCluster?

vCluster lets teams run virtual Kubernetes clusters on existing host clusters, giving each tenant an isolated control plane without creating separate physical clusters. It supports tenancy models from simple namespace isolation to fully dedicated nodes, GPUs, and bare metal. Environments are defined declaratively for easy, repeatable provisioning. By consolidating many virtual clusters onto fewer hosts, teams cut Kubernetes costs and simplify multi-tenant operations.

## What You'll Learn

In this scenario, we'll continue our journey with vCluster by exploring advanced configuration options and performance optimization techniques that are essential for production environments.

We'll build on what we've learned in previous scenarios to:
- Configure vClusters with advanced settings
- Optimize performance for different workloads
- Set up monitoring and observability
- Implement network optimization strategies
- Scale vClusters for production use

## What This Lab Covers

This scenario assumes you have a basic vCluster running from previous scenarios.
