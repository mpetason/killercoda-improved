# Welcome to vCluster 104 — Advanced Configuration

Every vCluster can be customized through a `vcluster.yaml` configuration file. This file controls everything from the control plane architecture to resource sync behavior between the virtual and host clusters.

In this scenario we will cover:

- Creating vClusters with custom `vcluster.yaml` configurations
- Setting resource limits and requests on the vCluster control plane
- Configuring sync behavior for different resource types
- Understanding control plane distro and backing store options
- Monitoring vCluster resource consumption

By the end, you will understand how to configure vClusters for different environments and requirements.
